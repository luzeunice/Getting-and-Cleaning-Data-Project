## Getting and Cleaning Data - Project

This repository contains my solution for the project of Getting and Cleaning Data class

run_analysis.R  is a script that dowload, read and clean the data to obtain two data sets

* The program download the file and unzip this. 
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subjec

The  run_analysis.R  script is commented to indicate what the program is doing.
